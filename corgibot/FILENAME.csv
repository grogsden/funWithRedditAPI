"My neighbor keep its poor dog (corgi) outside almost everyday all day and all night. Why(they have multiple people living there, there is always someone home)?! What can I do?? I’m tired of constant barking when I go outside and I feel bad for the dog!",34,obbluu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/obbluu/my_neighbor_keep_its_poor_dog_corgi_outside/,54,1625104145.0,"I live in the state of Missouri and I’m so tired of my neighbors dog !  They have a small and adorable corgi, which they keep outside 24/7. I’ve lived here 4 months and I have only seen the dog taken inside rarely at night or during pouring rain. It’s truly disgusting. Corgis aren’t even outside dogs! I have a pit bull and a cat and they’re not even outside a small fraction of how much that dog is. This dog barks constantly. And, I can’t hear it in my home but as soon as I step outside it’s mighty little bark is on surround sound. I am a very outsidesy person and I can never set on my back porch and read a book, work in my garden, play with my dog outside or anything without CONSTANT loud barking. This dog is miserable it cries and jumps on their door all day signaling them to please let him inside. I seriously will never understand how a human being can sit in their warm house and do what they do while having a innocent dog outside in the too cold or too hot weather ! I am so tired of not being able to enjoy my yard in peace without this barking as well as I feel so sorry for the dog. I am so fed up, what can I do? They have a dog house and I’m pretty sure if they have shelter I can’t report them but it’s interfereing with my own peace and sanity.  My and I daughter can’t even enjoy the outside of our own house.


•••
(This corgi does not like to be outside from what I see. It’s in a small fenced in area and constantly cries and barks at the back door. If your corgis are happy outside that’s great but I don’t believe this one is. Also, as I mentioned the dog is never inside, it does not get attention and they never go outside to play with it. It is only let inside during pouring rain or rarely at night time. It literally felt like 109° last week and it was not let in once.  I’d also like to mention there’s usually always someone home. It’s a rare occasion for no one to be going in and out of that house. Animal Control services says there is nothing they can do about excessive barking as long as the dog has adequate food, water and shelter. However, I do plan on talking to the neighbors. They weren’t home when I woke up, and they’re still not there. But, as soon as they get home(if not to late) or tomorrow morning I think I will go introduce myself and talk to them about the constant barking when I’m outside in my backyard. Hopefully they’re nice. )",2021-06-30 20:49:05
Corgis & Tails,1,ocx4xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ocx4xn/corgis_tails/,11,1625315322.0,"I’m getting a corgi next year & I’m curious about tail docking. I’ve done some research & obviously tail docking use to be for the liability factor, but now it’s for aesthetic reasons. I don’t really care about my dog being AKC registered or anything like that. So I’m wondering, should I request that my corgi keeps its tail? I like the look of the docked tail, but I don’t want it removed only for the aesthetic, especially if it’s going to cause issues in the future. Anyone else own a corgi or another breed with a docked tail? It’s still a couple months before I have to decide. I just let the breeder know before the pups are born. Any information will be appreciated!",2021-07-03 07:28:42
"[RIP] Waffle, Corizma Better Together CD RE CGC. Pembroke Welsh Corgi. June 20, 2009 - March 15, 2021.",1960,m7s3ny,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/m7s3ny/rip_waffle_corizma_better_together_cd_re_cgc/,116,1616077992.0,"I was 19. I felt alone, isolated, and trapped. There was no end in sight. I wanted to die. 

My counselor suggested that I do something I’ve always wanted to do. There was nothing. I had no goals of my own that I cared about. Except, I guess, for owning a Corgi. Being a pet lover herself, my counselor was delighted that I had an animal-related goal and encouraged me to pursue it. It was a weird goal for someone who grew up afraid of dogs.

I was 8. I had seen a movie on the Disney channel, “Murder She Purred: A Mrs. Murphy Mystery”, set in the foothills of Virginia and starring Ricki Lake, even though the real stars were a mystery-solving Tabby cat with a Corgi sidekick. I only saw that movie once, but it left a huge impression on me. 

I was 14. My friend, watching Cowboy Bebop for the first time, asked me if I liked Corgis. WTF is a Corgi? I looked it up. Ohmygod! It was the dog! From the movie!! Of course I like Corgis! 

I was 16. I was writing a story. The main character had a dog, a Corgi. The dog, like the one in the movie, was friendly, thoughtful, and kind. The dog was smart. The dog looked after the main character and his family. I named that dog “Waffle” because it was a stupid name for a dog but its silliness made me smile.  I fell in love with the dog I wrote. I fell in love with Waffle. [^^.](https://i.imgur.com/xlP0ewy.jpg)

I was 17. We were putting our own takes on the Mona Lisa in my favorite art class. After much debate, I decided to do a [Corgi Mona Lisa](https://i.imgur.com/zQvtxpb.jpg). My tablemates got to hear all about my future plans with my fictional dog. One of my tablemates was vocal about the fact that she did not like Corgis but she put up with my musings all the same. At the end of the project, she made a point to tell me that she felt like she would actually like Waffle if he were real, and she hoped I got my Waffle one day.

I was 19. I felt alone, isolated, and trapped. There was no end in sight. I wanted to die. With my counselor’s encouragement, the time I had previously spent ideating suicide was channeled into researching dog ownership and Corgis. I emailed every Virginia breeder listed on the breed club website. I received no response. 

After a couple of months, discouraged and with depression closing in on me, I decided to try again. I saw a name on the club listing that I hadn’t noticed before. They were from my hometown! And they lived in my high school’s neighborhood! I couldn’t screw this up. I changed my approach. I sent an email and I got a response. A real response!!  We had several emails back-and-forth, gathering information from each other. 

My parents had told me I could get a dog when I had my own place. I did not have my own place. They begrudgingly supported me in the interest of my mental health. I had a lot of things stacked against me. I was a college student in a rigorous field of study in a distant land, my family was generally unsupportive of the idea, I had never had a dog before—all major red flags to a breeder looking to place a dog. The breeder took a big chance on me and agreed to meet when I was back in town over winter break. 

When it came time to meet them, there was one dog, Mick, who jumped on the couch and sat in my lap eagerly. His breeders seemed a little surprised; apparently, that was out of character for Mick. I spent a good amount of time over there that winter break. The breeder felt that any of the puppies would be good for my situation, so I got to choose. I picked Mick. They held onto him (and started calling him “Waffle”) until I could bring him home at the end of the second semester, a month shy of his 1st birthday. 

I was not quite 20. I was home from school. As a family, we went to pick Waffle up from his breeders’.  We drove 15 minutes each way in my dad’s van. We got home and went to my room, our room. Waffle checked out his crate and then crawled under the bed. He crawled back out when I called for him. I gingerly touched his ruff and burst into tears. “What have I done? What made me think this was a good idea?” I was going to screw this up. I was going to be miserable. I was going to ruin this poor animal’s life. 

Waffle was with me for almost 11 years, more than a third of my life. He was with me through 7 addresses, 4 jobs, my undergraduate degree, my graduate degree, two and a half romantic partners, 2 break ups, my wedding, Banjo, my sister’s mental health crisis, 3 major family deaths, a mass shooting, a family divide, and countless high and low days. He was with me through it all. He was my rock and there is no one I would rather have had by my side.

Having the benefit of knowing what was ahead of us, I look back on those first-night doubts with amusement. We’ve come so far together, hand in hand. We brought out the best in each other—hence his registered name, “Better Together”. We really are better together. I say that in the present tense because he will always be with me. He has irreversibly shaped who I am today. He’s at the root of so many relationships and experiences. Every day with Waffle was truly a gift, a gift we gave each other. There is no octaffle without Waffle.

My mom once said, “That dog will never know how loved he was before he was even born,” but he knew. He definitely knew. She also thinks Waffle was an angel sent from heaven to take care of our family, and I think she is right. His presence in our lives is truly a blessing. 

He was the Waffle I fell in love with when I was 16 and then so much more. He was everything I needed. He propped me up. He gave me purpose. He shaped me into who I am today. He was so sensitive to my emotions and took his role of emotional support animal very seriously. He brought light to my entire family. His empathy, smarts, and talent endeared him to all he met. He was the type of dog that won over the hearts of the dog-free. He inspired so many and touched so many lives. He was more than a special dog. Waffle was my soulmate, irreversibly intertwined with my fate. 

He even secured me my research position, and therefore my current job! All of my present success would be impossible without Waffle, who guided me here. Yet I owe no debt to him, for he gave me his best and I gave my best to him in return. 

I don’t know who I would be without Waffle.

Thank you, Waffle, for going above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you for being there for me even before you were even born. Thank you for giving me the tools I need to better care for myself and others. Thank you for showing me that I don’t need to work with animals to have a deep, fulfilling bond with one. Thank you for being there for me every day. Thank you for being my dog.

And thanks to his breeder for looking beyond the inexperience and seeing the good in me. Thank you for being my dog parents. Thank you for changing my life by allowing me to care for the single greatest dog that ever walked the earth.

Does my corgi pee enough?,1,ob6hzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ob6hzy/does_my_corgi_pee_enough/,4,1625086912.0,"I've got a 7 month old corgi, now I've had many dogs in my life but I've never encountered this, I swear he doesn't pee enough.

He'll pee in the morning, and then again on his morning walk. Then again early afternoon. And he'll usually pee on his afternoon walk, after work. But as soon as it gets to bed time he'll just sit and look at you like ""wtf do you expect?"".

Is 3 times, and the usual marking, actually enough? Every other dog I've had would pee at every opportunity. I can't tell if he genuinely doesn't need to, or thinks if he holds out I'll take him on another walk.",2021-06-30 16:01:52
[Breeds] What breed would be best for us? Considering a corgi and possibly a border collie?,3,nrkqfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nrkqfa/breeds_what_breed_would_be_best_for_us/,9,1622745963.0,"\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?\*\*   

\*We are primarily considering a corgi but wishfully I would like a border collie. We are open to other breeds that you guys think would suit us based on the below.

My family got a border collie when I was in high school and I was her primary caregiver. I absolutely loved how biddable and sensitive she was as well as super smart. I did almost all of the caregiving for her and all of the training. She is absolutely wonderful and I got so much enjoyment out of bonding with her, taking her with me everywhere, and especially out of training her. She truly wanted to please her owner and was an absolute joy to work with. However, I think we got super lucky with her and a border collie might be “too much dog” for us at this stage.

My husband has wanted a corgi almost all of his life, and they seem to be a good fit for us — active but not overly so with some drive due to their herding background. I am concerned that I will not like how stubborn they are reputed to be especially as compared to a border collie.   

\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\* 

 \*They will be primarily a companion but I did some agility with my border collie and if it seemed like the dog would enjoy it I would really like that! We’re both very active and I would really love a dog that can keep me company on runs and walks — it’s boring being alone!  

\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?\*\*  

\*I was mostly the primary caregiver for my family’s border collie in high school and did her training. In the intervening time, I have also fostered eight dogs that have run the size/age spectrum. I love dogs and have been around them in some capacity my whole life.   

\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\*   

\*My husband and I have a two-year-old cat. We really like him and intend to have a cat in our lives forever. Therefore, it is extremely important that any dog we bring in has a low prey drive and be able to be taught to live peacefully with a cat.   

\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*   

\*We do not have children but plan to have some in five or so years, so it’s important that they be able to get along with children but the puppy stages and initial training will be done in a child-free household. We will work to socialize with children as much as possible to make sure that they can get along in the future. 

\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\*  

\*We currently rent an apartment that only has breed restrictions for “aggressive breeds”. The hope is to buy a home in the next couple of years but we’re not there yet.   

\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\*  

\*My husband and I live alone. We both will be responsible and are excited to have a dog but I would be the primary caregiver since my husband is in law school and I work from home full-time.  

\*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*   

\*About once or twice a week.  

\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?\*\*   

\*We are planning to go through a responsible breeder and will wait for the right puppy. I have fostered and volunteered extensively for our local shelter but with the cat, we really want to be sure for a medium to large dog that it will be a good long-term situation.  

\*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   

\*We want a puppy. We want to have the dog for its entire life and we have the time and energy and desire to work on shaping a dog as they grow. If one of the breeders had a young dog that didn’t work out for showing or working, we would consider that.  

\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\*  

\*We’re solidly in the medium dog camp. Not much bigger than a large Aussie, but not smaller than 20 or so pounds.  \*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   

\*All day every day would be too much, but barking at the door, noises etc is fine as are vocalizations.   

\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  

\*Willing to brush up to once a day.  

\*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\*  

\*Between the cat and the dog I expect we’ll be living in a furnato and that our Roomba will have its work cut out for it.   

\*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*   

\*Happy to clean ears and trim nails — we do the cat about once a week. Otherwise, we’d be open to taking the dogs to a groomer for anything more complicated.  \*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*   

\*Not huge on drool or farts.   

\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*   

\*It’s very important that the dog is biddable. I love training and working with the dog and it would take some fun out of dog ownership if the dog was just completely disinterested.  \*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*   

\*The basics for sure but would definitely go further. Ideally would like to do some off-leash work, maybe some agility, and a couple of fun/useful “tricks”.   

\*\*Is there any behavior you can’t accommodate?\*\*   

\*Cannot accommodate a dog with an intense prey drive for small animals. In addition, the dog must be able to be okay in public. Fine if dog parks and big crowds aren’t their things but we do like walking in the park, going on hikes, etc and if the dog couldn’t that would be a bummer.  \*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   

\*Fairly important. Mostly for recall and being able to take the dog out to the family ranch occasionally.   

\*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   

\*Generally I try to walk or run 6-7.5 miles a day. We go hiking about once a week, and I would also be happy to devote an hour or so additionally playing fetch, doing agility etc.   

\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   

\*I would be happy to do about two hours or so a day but could do more depending on the dog. Since I’m working from home I can do quite a bit in small chunks but longer sessions in the mornings/evenings.   

\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*   

\*Dog will sleep in our room but off the bed. Would crate train as a puppy but then would like to be able to leave the dog to have the run of the house when we’re gone.   

\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*   

\*Maybe two hours a day at first but up to a full workday in the coming years depending on job changes.  

\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy daycare, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*   

\*Yes, we’d be happy to do that.  

\*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\*  

\*We’re in Texas.  

\*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day\*\*  

\*Winter is about 50F and summer can get up to 110F.   

\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\*  

\*About an 8. We’re both very committed and have been raised with dogs as family members. The only foreseeable circumstance where that would change would be if the dog became seriously chronically ill.   

\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*   

\*Yes, we have plenty saved and are willing to pay for emergencies and the day to day expenses of a dog.",2021-06-03 13:46:03

I'm a travel nurse and I'm leaving for an assignment cross country (Massachusetts to Oregon) in a few weeks. I want to fly with my corgi (25 pounds, 11 inches tall) in the cabin. Cargo is not an option for me, I have heard way too many horror stories and would rather take a week to drive cross country than take the risk. I know some airlines have a 20-pound weight limit, but many do not and I feel more of them care about the dog actually fitting in the carrier. And since corgis are shaped differently than most dogs (short legs but with a thicker body), he is not as tall as a normal 25-pound dog so will have an easier time fitting in the carrier. I am looking for ay advice on what airlines to fly with or what airlines to avoid. Any first-hand experiences with specific airlines would be amazing and any other advice would be greatly appreciated!!",2021-05-20 22:11:38

She is great, high energy, talkative, and has a perfect smile. She is crate trained, and we don’t really let her be alone and wander in the house. Now that we are exiting the pandemic restrictions I am looking for some advice on what to do now in the mornings.

During the pandemic both of us would work from home almost every day and we both slept in. I am now working in the office full-time at a new firm where I am trying to kick ass. I am going to be in the office before 9, but often my girlfriend doesn’t get up until 10 (insomnia so lack of sleep, plus benefit of a 10-6 job). This begs the question, what do I do with the Welsh lass? This morning I got up at 6:30 and walked her to tire her out so she wouldn’t annoy Mom all day, but I am going to leave for work shortly. She can’t be with Mom when she’s trying to sleep because she will bork like crazy the second she sees Mom (she’s the favorite). But, if I put her in her crate before I go to work, she will probably still bork (and currently is as I type) because we just walked an hour ago and she’s not sleepy.

It is sort of a lose/lose situation for Mom. The obvious solution is she just wakes up earlier, but she has really rough sleep issues she deals with every day and that’s why I am asking around here, to avoid that. Does anyone have any advice or tips on what I could do with this low-center-of-gravity fiend either before I leave or set up for while I am gone, to avoid waking Mom up early?

I’ve been to 2 vets about this concern, and I just wanted to gather other people’s opinions too. But basically my corgi’s front 2 middle claws are worn down, and I’m not sure why. He’s 2 years old and doesn’t have any health/genetic issues that I know of.

As for what the vets said, the first vet said it was 100% arthritis and gave me no other explanations. She was just really blunt about it and didn’t really give any other possible explanations so I wanted a second opinion. The second vet also said it could be arthritis, but it could also be a nerve issue or it could just be my corgi’s normal gait. When he mentioned gait, I started looking back on older pictures of my corgi and noticed that all his front claws seemed normal. I think I mainly started to notice his front 2 middle claws being worn down in the summer of 2020 (or a little before summer possibly)

Other than that, I don’t really notice any telltale signs of arthritis or a nerve issue. He’s still active, loves to go on walks, and he’ll sprint around in our backyard too. I guess the only possible signs are that he doesn’t sprint for long in the backyard, and that he lags behind after 30-45 minutes of a brisk walk? (But that could be him being lazy heh). Also, I notice that his front legs will tremble sometimes if he’s just sitting.

Here are some pictures below!

I thought it was weird, stretched her arm, felt her arm - she seemed fine. The next morning, it was gone. 

My other dog had a limp for a few days once a few months back and I took him to the vet and he ended up being fine, just strained it from playing too rough. It went away and he hasn’t limped since. So, I figured I wouldn’t worry about my younger dog since she didn’t seem to have the limp anymore….that is, until later on that day, when she got out of her nap. Limping again, on the same left leg. Again I checked it - nothing. I checked her paws, and didn’t see anything abnormal, except that maybe the vet cut a bit too close to the pink skin under her nail. But they didn’t tell me anything, they said she did fine.

Everyday it’s been the same. The morning she is fine, no limp at all, running and walking outside normally. She didn’t have the limp all day today and just a few minutes ago, she got up when I got up to get some water - and the limp is back! She was napping. She has been in my office hanging out with me all day, no rough housing, no playing. Just chilling. 

Has someone experienced this before? Any advice? Obviously I will call the vet if it doesn’t get better.",2021-05-14 20:28:42

Back in early September Dug had been acting strange and lethargic. After a few vet visits and several tests he was diagnosed with a large tumor on his liver as well as advanced kidney disease. Though the tumor could have been removed with surgery, the kidney issues made it a risky option that even if successful, would likely only give him a year or two more at most. I made the decision to forgo surgery and try to enjoy the time I had left with him.

Though these last four months passed much too quickly, I tried to fill them with his favorite things and people. Four months of chasing squirrels in the yard. Fourth months of watching cartoons with my son. Four months of rubbing his face into the carpet at my brother's house. Four months of walks with my mom. Four months of barking at my dad for no particular reason.

When he was no longer able to jump up on the bed I got him stairs. When he no longer had an appetite for kibble I carved up rotisserie chickens for him. When he was no longer able to climb into Nana's car I lifted him up. But when he was no longer able to eat or drink and was barely able to stand on his own, I knew it was time. I really wanted to spend one more Christmas with him but I knew that letting him suffer any longer would be cruel.

He always hated the vets office so to spare him from spending his last moments in abject terror, I found one that made home visits. I spread out his favorite blanket on the living room floor and when she arrived, he put up no fuss and laid right down on it. He dozed off with his head in my hands and slipped away peacefully while I stroked his fur and whispered in his ear that I loved him and that he was a good boy. I carried him to the back of a van, planted one last kiss on his nose, and he was taken away to be cremated. I plan on spreading his ashes in some of his favorite places: My back yard, the woods at my parents house, up in the White Mountains, and at a small beach in Massachusetts where he, my son, and I spent many beautiful sunny days.

I'm profoundly heartbroken that he's gone and I'm surrounded by reminders that he's no longer here. Every time I drop food on the floor I forget that he's not around to hoover it up. I still expect him to launch himself off the couch with a bark whenever an animal appears on the TV. And I'll be finding Dug hairs on my clothes, around my house, and in my car for years to come. But I'm thankful for the ten short years I got to spend with him. If given the option to go back in time knowing how this decade-long journey would end, I would still make the choice to adopt him a million times out of a million.

Eons ago when I was researching golden retriever breeders I located my breeder through recommendations on the golden retriever forum. The community there was *amazing* when I struggled through puppy hood and training issues. 

I checked the rules for this sub and I don't believe this is disallowed so here are some links for the breed specific forums for some of the more popular dog breeds. Some of the forums might be a bit out of date but I'm sure there would still be useful information. And if anyone else knows of some other great forums please chime in!

[Help] Corgi Upper Molar Fractures - Root Canal vs Extraction,1,lpurfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/lpurfv/help_corgi_upper_molar_fractures_root_canal_vs/,3,1614015976.0,"Hi all!

I took my 3 year old corgi to her primary vet a week ago for shots, and they discovered that her upper molars are fractured. One has the pulp showing, and the other is cracked. They recommended a root canal, saying that they would hate to extract the molar of a young, healthy dog and referred us to a dental specialist. 

We went to the specialist this morning and they confirmed that on one molar the pulp is showing. On the other, it's cracked but they can't tell is the pulp is showing because the cracked part of the tooth hasn't come off. They're hoping that they can remove the broken piece and there won't be any pulp and the tooth can be salvaged, but said to expect the worst.

So essentially, I'm looking at either 2 root canals or 2 extractions. The price I was quoted for 2 root canals is $3,954. If only one ends up being needed, it will be $2,951. Two extractions by the specialist would be $2,702, and one would be $2,225

There is an affordable care clinic nearby that can do extractions for $355. This is my first dog, so I feel awful that she cracked her teeth on a toy I thought was good for her to chew. I'm very tempted to go the route of possibly 2 root canals, since the specialist said the molars are strategically important teeth and the failure rate is very low. But he also mentioned that extractions can be the way to go if I don't want to worry about the teeth in the future, but I'd need to be careful about her bottom molars getting dirty/diseased since the top ones would be missing/not there to protect them.

I'm really torn here...4k is not a small amount of money, and the upper molars are two of her biggest teeth. I've seen a lot of people say that dogs will not miss a couple of teeth, but does that apply to their upper molars? I just want to make the best decision possible for her so any advice/insight would be appreciated!",2021-02-22 11:46:16
[Breeds] Seriously thinking of getting a corgi,0,ln17dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ln17dh/breeds_seriously_thinking_of_getting_a_corgi/,3,1613692731.0,"
 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* First dog as a couple/adults, both had dogs growing up and I volunteered with service dogs in training throughout college 

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Breeder, for a predictable temperament 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Goes many places with me, friendly, smart, agile, hoping the dog will get me more active than I currently am. Good with kids and other dogs.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* corgi (first choice), mini schnauzer (had growing up), golden, spaniel, doxie, eventually want more than 1 dog so definitely open to multiple suggestions that compliment each other and good with other dogs

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* everything from basic obedience to cool tricks. I really want to dedicate time to training 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* low level agility could be cool but not required, no current experience 

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* A lot, we work from home so have time for training and playing sessions throughout the day. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* ~1 hour of outdoor exercise (long walk, fetch, park, etc) weekdays, more on weekends, along with some indoor play and mental exercises

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I would brush daily, and would dremmel nails and bathe as needed, but no trimming unless it’s a small amount on paw pads or something.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* medium, eventually would be open to small (not chihuahua small) or big (but not Great Dane big)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is okay, we have a roomba, grew up with a barking dog so it doesn’t bother me however I would like to work on a “quiet” command for certain instances. Slobber is less desirable 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very, I want to know I can recall my dog 100% of the time (with lots and lots of training)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* an independent dog that frequently gets into a snuggly mood, if that makes sense.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* a little of both. I don’t want them to become completely dependent on us for every aspect and develop social anxiety, but I still want a strong connected bond with my dog and will be home a large amount of time and can spend a lot of time with the dog

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A first bark alert and run to the door is fine, listening to a “sit and wait” command after until someone enters the home before saying hi is a plus.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, we want a dog we can take to dog friendly spaces without much worry of aggression, we want no unprovoked aggression. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* I wouldn’t want to take the dog to the groomer routinely at this time (schnauzer is out for this for no, but some time in the future when I have even more time and money, hopefully)

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* ~2 hours a day for dinner on weekends, maybe you to 6 hours on the weekends depending on what we are doing, but would like to bring the dog along to friends houses/dog friendly restaurants when possible

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* other person will be dedicated to training, taking the dog out, playing and cuddling but I will probably be the primary trainer especially during the puppy stage

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* will want more dogs in the future. Possible a reptile kept up high and away from the dog’s access 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* we don’t currently have kids but will plan to have kids most likely within the next 10 years 

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Rent for now but plan to own a home within 3-5 years. No bully breeds, Alaskan malamutes or chow chows for this reason

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, no laws to my knowledge 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are pretty hot, can get in the 100s, in winter we rarely go below 10 degrees on the coldest days usually 30-50s",2021-02-18 17:58:51
Herding Ball for a Corgi [Discussion],3,kuizmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/kuizmm/herding_ball_for_a_corgi_discussion/,6,1610300613.0,"Hi I recently started looking into herding balls for my corgi. Does anyone have any reccomendations on a ball he can push around the yard? I'm thinking of just purchasing a soccer ball after I ran into some issues with the others below.

Apparently harder plastic balls can wear down the teeth of a dog when they try to bite it while it's rolling so I went with some softer balls.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EMSVVIK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_gLZ-FbDT28EF0

So the Jolly Ball is nearly perfect. My corgi boops its around the yard constantly with its nose and its a durable softer rubber. However after about twenty minutes of play I saw some blood on the snout of my dog. It would seem my dogs nose was getting rubbed raw. My guess would be the raised text that says ""Jolly Ball"" did it but I'm not sure. I'm considering trying to sand it down (I'm not very handy but I think I can do it) as he loves it so much. I'm letting his nose heal for a week before I try again.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0084DRJKO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_uUZ-FbY1EFWK9?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1

I grabbed the Chuck It kick ball at the pet store the other day. It's made from a softer nylon material and the dog can even pick it up if it wants. Well, it worked great but my dog just kept picking it up and walking around with it rather than knocking it around the yard and chasing it. Still a great ball I just kept having to run up and kick the ball so my dog would chase it.",2021-01-10 11:43:33
[Help] Burs in the paws and a very reactive dog. Boot recommendation for Corgi/Swedish-Vallhund?,4,kramhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/kramhv/help_burs_in_the_paws_and_a_very_reactive_dog/,7,1609889000.0,"A while ago I asked if boots would be a good option to avoid burs because my dog will bite if you try to remove them and they’re pretty much unavoidable in the areas I can walk him. I got boots but they seemed to stress him out on walks because he kept falling on his face or the boots would just fall off (I really thought they were tight enough) or they would even dig into his heels.

The only area of my neighborhood that doesn’t have burs has a LOT of dogs in backyards that are unavoidable and my dog is very reactive... it’s a stressful walk for both of us.

Does anyone have suggestions for boots that would properly fit Corgi/Swedish-Vallhund feet without falling off or digging into a heel? And should I try different boots for winter and summer, I don’t want him to overheat in the summer but I don’t want his feet soaked if it snows.

We just came back from a walk where he got two burs stuck in the paws and honestly I don’t know how we made it back.",2021-01-05 17:23:20

"[Breeds] 1st (ish) time owner, looking at two breeds - Pembroke Welsh Corgi or Whippet",4,krkgvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/krkgvx/breeds_1st_ish_time_owner_looking_at_two_breeds/,5,1609924753.0,"
 **Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I’ve lived with my wife‘s family dog. I’ve spent plenty of time with her and have taken care of her when they were out of town and have taken care of friends/family dogs as well. My wife (who will be also the co-owner of the dog) has plenty of experience with her own family pets, volunteer work through local animal shelters and working at doggy day care.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We will be going through a reputable breeder. I’m already contacting local breeders.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* We’re looking for a pup (small to medium) that can snuggle while I watch a laker game as well as the typical tug o war and fetch, but can be our weekend warrior active buddy when we go on hikes, the beach, etc (I’m imagining a post Covid world where some semblance of normalcy is restored)

Wife and I would love to bring our pup out (again post Covid imagination) to dog parks and dog friendly places, so we’d love a dog that is sociable and comfortable with other pups.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* We have narrowed it down to a Whippet or a Pembroke Welsh Corgi.

We also were on the goldendoodle craze train, but I immediately hopped off after seeing so many horror stories on this sub.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basic commands like sit, stay, lay down, leave it, wait for food, etc. We’re mainly looking at commands that have to do with obedience.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* We’re just looking for a companion.

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* as long as we need! Outside of work, my wife and I have a pretty clear schedule.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* during the typical work week I can devote 1-2 hours (am/pm) and my wife can squeeze in time around lunch time since she works from home. That’s on the low end. On the weekends we can devote much more time. We will implement a dog park once it’s safe to do so for our pup as well as us.

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* daily brushing and grooming is not a problem. I’ve taken care of friends goldens, my wife’s family Akita/German Shepard and my sisters pug with daily face wrinkle cleaning. We are also open to taking our pup to a groomer as well.

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* small-medium (no bigger than 30-40 lbs)

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don’t mind shedding or slobber, but I wouldn’t be sad if low shedding/slobber was an option lol. When it comes to barking, as long as it’s not excessive yapping (looking at you Chihuahuas), then it’s not a problem for me. If it’s the typical bark to alert someone’s at the door, I’m totally cool with that.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be cool but unnecessary. My wife’s Akita/German Shepard could never be off leash so I’m used to it.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggle buddy for sure, but if they want their space from time to time I’m cool with that. Looking for that happy medium!

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I’d love an eager to please pup, but I’m used to having an independent dog around.

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Just to be alert. They don’t need to be extremely vocal about it.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* depending on how excessive and if it can be worked out through proper training, then yes.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Not that I can think of

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* my wife works from home, so not long if we had to go out for the typical take out/grocery run. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* this will be a joint effort between my wife and me.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* when it’s time to buy a house (years down the road) we are open to getting another dog, but would look for a compatible breed to whatever breed we initially choose this time around.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Occasionally. We rent a house on a ranch, and our landlords have two kids 3rd-5th grade, and I’m sure they’d want to interact with our pup.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We currently rent a one bedroom house with no firm breed/weight restrictions. We are trying to avoid typical restricted dogs (huskies, German Shepards, pitbulls, etc) in case our living situation changes in the future.

Before I get hate, I have experience with those breeds and they all have a special place in my heart, I’m just being pragmatic.

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We live in the central coast of CA, but I’m not aware of any specific breeds banned in our area, just the typical rent restrictions on certain breeds.

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers can get to high 80s-90s and Winters get as low as 30s (Fahrenheit bc I’m a dopey American). 

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We were originally hoping to adopt a retired greyhound, but as soon as we were ready, covid hit and our personal lives were changed because of it. Now that my wife and I are in a better spot, the list for rescues were insanely long (a volunteer said it would probably be 2 years). 

I’m pretty set between a whippet or a corgi. I’ve read about the pros and cons of each, and just want some feedback from folks that have experience with these breeds. I’m open to folks giving me other ideas, and I’m appreciative for everyone’s opinions, so thank you!

If you go through my history I’ve been bouncing around a lot about his. 

My beautiful little boy and best friend passed yesterday after a heart attack from a bad reaction to anesthesia from getting neutered.

His name was Buster. I’ve always wanted a dog name buster since I was a kid. He was one of the firs dogs I got on my own. A gorgeous little Pomeranian who’d sit on my lap when I worked. I feel like I let him down.  My corgis best friend. 

I just feel like a shell of my self. I’ve never experienced such a horrible pain. I can’t go more than 20 minutes without crying hysterically. I shout loud apologies at no one and I can’t control it. 

I can’t stop blaming myself for taking him to a procedure he didn’t need. I lost my baby boy and I don’t know what to do. I’ve lost people before but this just hurts so much more. 


My fiancée and I are really into ice skating so I kind of forced us to go and it really helped. But I get in the car and immediately start bawling and panicking again. 

I had this horrible cycle of sleeping for 10-15 minutes and waking up but every dream was about him. It was torture and the most traumatizing thing. My fiancée is really worried about me because I’m just really not handling it well. I’m empty. My family is broken and I feel like a different person. 

I’ve developed an awful separation anxiety from my fiancée and our other dog and I’m just so scared to be alone. 

I joked that I’d be stuck with him for 20years like my moms chihuahua and now I’m hurting that won’t happen. 


I’m starting therapy tomorrow but I’m wondering if anyone has advice with how to deal. I’m having such a hard time keeping food down. I have this beautiful tattoo idea for him to memorialize.

Dog breeds for cat owners,7,o7r2yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/o7r2yp/dog_breeds_for_cat_owners/,31,1624638272.0,"Hello, all!

Our senior rescue Badger passed away last week.  We adopted him at 12 a bit over 2 years ago.  He was corgi, black lab, and Australian shepherd, but had zero prey drive considering his age.  He got along amazingly with all of our 4 cats, although 2 of them (the oldest 2) were not always thrilled about Badger for no good reason.

Anyway, we are looking to adopt/rescue another dog!  What breeds are generally good with cats, or conversely, what breeds are NOT good with cats?  Our cats range from 1-8 years old and are generally pretty laid back and friendly.  I do know hounds and herding breeds should generally be avoided.

\*\*Introduction\*\*

&#x200B;

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&#x200B;

No - I grew up with dogs and recently lost my first dog I didn't share with my parents/siblings.

&#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&#x200B;

Rescue preferably.

&#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&#x200B;

Relaxed, loving, good with other people, good with other dogs, and good with cats.

&#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&#x200B;

I personally prefer bigger dogs with softer coats, like a golden retriever, but the isn't a hard requirement.  

&#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&#x200B;

I hadn't really thought of this.  Probably basic tricks like come, stay, shake, etc

&#x200B;

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

[Fluff] [Help] Officially adopting my very first rescue today!!!!!! She's a corgi mix from the Ukraine and the cutest thing ever <3,1146,g4qw0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/g4qw0j/fluff_help_officially_adopting_my_very_first/,95,1587381185.0,"I'm just so excited I have to tell somebody! I've been ~~im~~patiently waiting and watching my corgi tracker on petfinder for the better part of two years - after moving out and saying bye to my parent's dog Schnauzie (I couldn't have dogs where I moved, so she's chilling with my parents now - a mini schnauzer who is adorable but very aloof) I've always wanted a dog of my own, but something  always got in the way. And then somehow magically, less than a week after I moved into a house that allowed dogs again, this little lady popped up. I pounced, and I was fostering to adopt a few days later. Meet Sparrow!

[https://imgur.com/gallery/GsnhCoV](https://imgur.com/gallery/GsnhCoV)

(This happened like... 2 days before the whole pandemic thing settled in. 100% guarantee I would have gone mad with cabin fever if I hadn't gotten her beforehand.)

Today the final paperwork is being submitted, and then Sparrow will be mine forever!!!! <3 Other than just a complete spazzing freakout of excitement, I'm curious what you guys think she is. Corgi seems pretty likely, but the rest is a big ol ??????. Silky, German Shepherd, Sheltie, and Dachshund are the ones thrown around the most, but I'd love to hear what you guys think  - she has three different types of fur on her, or at least that's what it feels like, and one leg and half of her tail that's almost wolfish in texture! I've only ever owned a mini schnauzer before so all this different fur is all new to me, heh.

Anyways, this is just a 'yayyyyyy!' post, as well as people with far more experience than me guessing at what the heck she is :P Also anyone with tips for corgi-like little stubby dogs, or anything that I should know that my fervent googling would be unlikely to dig up. The more advice the better... especially food suggestions. I love her to bits but she's the pickiest eater I've ever seen. Tried various different dry and wet foods (as did her rescue before I got her) with thoroughly meh results. Just ordered a trial of Ollie (one of those fresh dog food delivery services), should be getting it in a few days, curious what you guys think or if you have any better suggestions! Thanks in advance <3

They totally are BUT they’re also herding dogs who thrive with exercise and  job to do! 

My neighbors (in an apartment building) got a corgi just a bit ago and it really doesn’t seem like they work with her enough :/ They just tell her no over and over, and take her out for like 15min walks max at a time. They’ve started yelling at her more and more (just yelling ‘no’ and then ‘shut up’ when she barks), I just don’t get what they think is going to happen. 

It’s really frustrating to hear and tonight they’re having a party and I can hear their dog not having fun :( 

I hate it and I wish they cared about their doggy enough to look into her needs. I know I’m hardcore judging them, but I’m just sad for this Bork. Also they’re being really loud, so I’m probably just more annoyed at them than usual. They probably could have done better with a lazier dog.",2020-07-19 00:33:03

[breeds] Friendly dog to complement a corgi? Help us choose our next companion.,3,jxakgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/jxakgd/breeds_friendly_dog_to_complement_a_corgi_help_us/,15,1605817745.0,"\*\*Introduction\*\*

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

\* No. We have a 2-year-old pembroke corgi raised from a puppy. He is my first dog, fiancé had a few family dogs growing up. I’ve included details on our current dog below to hopefully a) finding a compatible dog and b) highlight traits that I’m looking for out of dog 2.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

\* Reputable breeder

3) Describe your ideal dog.

\* Eager-to-please, lovable, cuddly, confident. Gentle, family-friendly, and enjoys pets/affection. Will have a biddable personality and take to training with natural focus and aptitude. Solid temperament, obedient/reliable in all settings. Medium to medium-high energy, with a good off-switch and can settle at home and in public. Generally healthy with double digit life expectancy. (Hopefully this isn’t a unicorn lol)

\* For reference - our corgi is wonderful and has a true-to-breed personality. He is companionable, but not needy. Whip-smart, quick-learner, but has a mind of his own. Outgoing and fun. He is bold, yet kind and full of personality. Never aggressive. Compared to him, we ideally want next dog to be more biddable, more cuddly, less sensitive, with less of an independent streak.

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\* We do have a specific breed in mind, but are curious to see if it gets suggested. We've considered several breeds in the sporting, herding, and non-sporting groups.

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

\* General to advanced obedience. Tricks. Fetch. I'd also like to explore therapy if dog 2 has the aptitude, especially since there would be skill and interest crossover from obedience work and my nursing career.

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

\* I’ve dabbled in beginner obedience training with our corgi and will continue to work with him. We’ve earned CGC and a few trick titles so far. He is highly capable, but I sometimes struggle given his play/chase drive, independence, and sensitivity to movement/excitement. I realize this isn’t insurmountable with training/proofing, but sometimes it feels like I’m swimming upstream. I would love to work with a more naturally handler-focused, eager-to-please, less environmentally sensitive, and (frankly) an “easier” dog.

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

\* I’m happy to do multiple brief sessions of play and training every day, as well as offer enrichment activities such as puzzle feeders, sniffy walks, etc. I also plan for structured training classes.

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

\* I’d say about 1-2 hours per day split between walks, fetch, training activities, etc. And more on weekends including hikes and other outings. Maybe some light jogging when he/she is old enough. We very rarely go to dog parks, and don’t rely on them for exercise. I’ll gladly give this dog a job to do, but also don’t want a dog that will eat my couch after an occasional lazy day.

9) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

\* Don’t mind using a groomer occasionally, but prefer basic home management. We currently bathe, clean ears brush fur, brush teeth, and trim nails/paw fur ourselves. Ideally that should cover our next dog as well.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

10) What size dog are you looking for?

\* Medium ideally. Can do medium-large for the right dog. No extremes on either end please.

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

\* We’re used to shedding. Less barking is better, but limited alert barking is ok. Not a big fan of slobber.

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

\* Pretty important? I don’t plan on letting the dog roam unsecured areas, but definitely do want an off-leash reliable dog in the ring and at the park.

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

\* Snuggly/enjoys affection, but not excessively needy.

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

\* Eager-to-please

15) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

\* A few alert barks are fine as long as they stop on command. We want gentle, polite greetings with guests. Preferably friendly, but not over-excited with strangers.

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

\* No.

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

\* Human or dog aggression. General reactivity. Resource guarding. Separation anxiety, or generally anxious or high-strung. Destructiveness. Stubbornness.

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

\* At most 8 hours on work days, but we try to stagger our schedules. If our circumstances change, we don’t mind hiring a walker or doing daycare as needed.

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

\* My fiancé really wants a loving, cuddly weighted blanket of a dog. He also wants a more biddable dog than our current. He will help with routine care and playtime, but I will be more involved with training.

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

\* One adult corgi. He is agreeable with most other dogs, but his playstyle can be a little too exuberant for some smaller dogs. He enjoys chase and wrestling. Though he is medium energy and spends most of his days napping anymore.

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

\* When we start a family yes, and if we pursue therapy work. Being good with children is a must.

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

\* N/A

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

\* Southern US, N/A

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

\* Hot, humid summers 90F, mild pleasant winters 70F. We may move to an area with real seasons, though.

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

\* This is our initial research and we wouldn’t be getting this dog for a few years, after we’ve found the right breeder and have upgraded to a home with a fenced yard.

26) Feel free to ask any questions below.

\* Our current top contender breed is >!a show-line golden retriever!< and I want to make sure this is the right choice for us. I do worry a bit about health and cancer rates. Is cancer risk something that can be minimized by working with a reputable breeder or no? What should I be looking for and asking these breeders? What other breeds should we consider?

[Help] 2 year old Corgi with a Marking Problem,1,ky7ntw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/ky7ntw/help_2_year_old_corgi_with_a_marking_problem/,3,1610756290.0,"My 2 year old male corgi has a bad marking problem. I think this is largely because when we first got him, we used training pads. Worst. Idea. Ever. He got the idea that he can go inside, took him FOREVER to get him use to grass, but eventually after lots and lots of walks, he got the idea.

However, he still marks. Sometimes it seems like he genuinely needed to go and I missed the signals. Other times, it’s such a little bit that I think he‘s trying to make me mad - but I know from research that’s not the case.

It’s actually gotten a \*little\* bit better lately since I bought these wraps to put on him - he HATES them, so whenever he ends up peeing and I catch him, I put it on him, wait an hour, then take it off and take him outside, then reward the hell out of him after he goes. That seems to work, because now he starts to wine and stand near my living room door if he really needs to go.

But just last night when we went to bed, he peed just a little bit! This is right after his evening walk, where he peed and pooped!

I already spent the money checking for bladder infection or kidney infections. He is very healthy. Eats scheduled meals, I stop giving him water after 8pm. I keep him in my line of sight at all times.

His sister is an angel, and holds it always. So it’s just him. Am I doing everything right? Is there more I can do? I know correcting past behavior takes a long time, but I really hoped he’d be past this by now.",2021-01-15 18:18:10

[Help] 19-month Corgi has terminal Cancer and I don't know what to do,19,iyiix3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/iyiix3/help_19month_corgi_has_terminal_cancer_and_i_dont/,16,1600893342.0,"My  19-month old corgi was diagnosed with terminal cancer about a week ago. 

Last week, we took him to a hospital where after an ultrasound and a needle aspirate, they determined it was a form of round-cell cancer, but it was inconclusive as to whether it was lymphoma or an embryonal tumor. Neither would be receptive to surgery, only lymphoma would be responsive to chemo. The vet put him on a dose of Elspar chemo in an attempt to determine what type of cancer he had, and then he was discharged into our care. 

The next day, he showed marked improvement. Happy, playing, eating finally. We were pleased. I was concerned that this energy turnaround may have been from his additional medications (including prednisone), but the doctor said this wouldn't be the case -- it had to be from chemo. 

Fast forward to today. We see the oncologist who determines that his tumor has not shrunk (that he could notice) and suspects that the behavior improvement could be from the prednisone (contradicting the vet from last week). 

So, the vet has put him on a CHOP therapy (vincristine) to see if that helps shrink the tumor, but he didn't seem super optimistic. Maybe that's me misreading things. 

If the chemo works, we have an estimated 6-9 months. If it doesn't, we have ""weeks."" 

I'm just devastated. I don't know what to do, and I don't know what to look for. Has anyone had any experience with dogs and lymphoma or dogs on chemo? How quickly do treatments kick in, and what signs should I be looking for that things are getting better (or things are getting worse)? 

Beyond that, what the hell am I supposed to do? How do you handle a terminal dog when the dog doesn't know ""he's terminal?"" 

How do you grieve? How do you move on? When is it acceptable to add another dog into your life?

I apologize if this is a lot or if any of it sounds insensitive. I have received waves of conflicting information and emotions this week. He's my world, and I've now received news that he's not going to make it. The question really is, when will that be?",2020-09-23 15:35:42

3. [A third thing has gone horribly wrong in teaching my dog to wiggle his left ear](https://new.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3g4u7h/fluffupdate_a_third_thing_has_gone_horribly_wrong/) 

I taught my Corgi, Waffle, to wiggle his ear(s) as a stupid trick. I lost control of the monster I created and Waffle began using the ear movement to indicate he wanted something. He did it ALL the time. It was obnoxious but only if you knew what he was doing. Like, you’d think he’s sitting quietly, being a gentleman, listening to lots of sounds around him or something. But no, he’s actually sitting there saying, “I want” over and over.  [Here’s the video from the third post]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv7iSsLelOY) showing some sample ear movements.

# Update

Waffle continued to use his ear movement as a signal for “I WANT” throughout his life. Though I never taught him the final version of the trick (“fly away” and “tune your satellites”), the ear movements became much more controlled and were a very effective and reliable bit of communication. Tater wasn’t the only dog who experimented with wiggling the ears. We watched my grad advisor’s Corgi one weekend and she was doing the ear thing by her last day with us. You could tell she didn’t really understand why ear wiggling was the norm but she was doing it anyway.

Waffle attended countless cookouts at my parents’ house during his life. He didn’t eat his regular dog food on cookout days because he usually got his own plate and we expected everyone at the party to liberally feed him their scraps. At some point, my sister’s boyfriend’s family started bringing their little Yorkie, Daisy, to the cookouts at my parents’. Daisy hadn’t really been fed people food until her humans saw how we showered Waffle with it. Time went on and we were allowed to give Daisy whatever food we wanted, as long as we were cognizant of her size and how much she had already eaten. I regularly offered her bits of food alongside Waffle. 

This past November, Daisy’s humans gave her too much Thanksgiving turkey and everyone had a bad time with the aftermath. Since then, we all pulled back on feeding Daisy at the cookouts, but I’d still give her some (with permission!) when she sidled up next to Waffle. 


Waffle died this past March. Daisy is now the only dog at my parents’ cookouts.

At my parents’ Memorial Day cookout this past weekend, I was seated next to Daisy’s humans. Daisy was unsuccessfully asking her owner to hold her at the dinner table. I saw her almost try to force her way into the lap but then she stopped herself. Good girl, Daisy. Exercising restraint deserves a reward, so I offered her a bit of meat. She took it happily and then looked for more. She totally forgot she ever wanted to sit in her owner’s lap and was laser focused on me. I went back to eating but could feel her trying to get my attention. I looked down and made eye contact. 

Did I imagine what I saw? Holy shit.

I looked away and then looked back at her and SHE DID IT AGAIN. She wiggled her ear the way Waffle used to!! The movement was extremely deliberate. She rotated it back, returned it halfway to the front position, rotated it back again, and then brought it to rest at the front. She did it while making eye contact, or trying to. 

Oh my GOD!!! I could hardly believe it. You bet I rewarded that annoying ear wiggle!! (Once a sucker, always a sucker, amirite?) She did it a few more times until I ran out of stuff to offer her. When I was done, she turned to her owner and asked to get in the lap, but she added the ear wiggle to her usual way of asking. Her owner picked her up and held her. How was anyone supposed to say “no” when she asked using a trick that our beloved Waffle taught her? Daisy was very pleased with herself. That crazy Corgi bastard was right. All you’ve gotta do is flick your ear and the humans will give you everything you want. 

It filled me with so much joy to see Daisy using the ear wiggle spontaneously. The grin on my face spread from ear to ear, and once everyone else recognized what was happening, it spread to all of them too. What a moment. It was like Waffle was back at the table with us and it was perfect. 

[Here’s a bonus video of Waffle using the ear movements to try to communicate with the cat]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fghVEW_x7Fs). Attempts to persuade her to relinquish the rodent were unsuccessful.",2021-06-02 09:17:02

She's the second double coated dog I've ever owned.  Because money's a bit tight right now i cannot take her to the groomer to get a full deshed groom. So I'm taking a simple dog brush to get all that fur out multiple times a week right now. 

My hubs noticed today the pile of fluff in the backyard that looked like our dog exploded. He got annoyed because it could get in the sandbox.  I laughed because then he got full blown worried as he watched several birds land in our yard to ""eat the fur"". He asked that i go out there and pick up all the fur i left behind. 

I got the pleasure of telling him,  they're not eating fur.  They're lining their nests with it. I asked if he ever saw the dog fur from over the last week. When he said no, i pointed out the birds all took it. 

I still went out and picked up the clumps of fur that weren't imbedded in the grass and plopped it in a formula can for the birds to take. Just to watch my nutty dog pluck a huge clump from the grass and attempt to play with it. Lmao.

She's got tons more shedding to do,  and i intend to try to get most of it out via brushing.  And while i know it's hot outside right now,  I've decided against  making a second mistake of attempting it in the house. I'm still vacuuming balls of fur from that and the shedding she's still doing.",2021-06-12 22:34:24

# Waffle’s Cancer

The tumor was diagnosed incidentally in July 2020 and was removed a week later, just in the nick of time. Two weeks after that, we got the biopsy report. Cancer – “soft tissue sarcoma”, “splenic stromal sarcoma”, “spindle cell sarcoma” – basically, cancer of the cells holding the spleen together. There’s very little literature on this type of cancer in dogs or in people. There was no evidence of metastasis at the time of removal, though the surgeon noted his lymph nodes “looked a little angry”. If I could go back in time and be in the operating room with her, I would make her remove them! 

If you’re a nerd or just want to know what a cancer biopsy report looks like, [here’s his biopsy](https://imgur.com/TbbrqrQ). If you’re curious as to what the cancer itself actually looked like, [here is the tumor-spleen chimaera (NSFL for you squeamish folk)](https://imgur.com/eL792Yc). Kudos to the surgeon for taking the time to snap a picture for me. Normal spleen tissue looks like that dark red, flattish bit at the bottom. You can see that the cancer totally took over the spleen, as noted in the biopsy—“little normal appearing splenic tissue present”. I think the tumor was approximately 2 pounds (0.9 kg) when removed. 

The biopsy notes the mitotic count was greater than 50. Mitotic count is the number of cells undergoing mitosis (cell division, i.e. growth) in the microscope field of view. The pathologist counted 50 cells dividing and then gave up counting, which indicates the cancer is extremely aggressive and growing rapidly. Within 7 weeks of spleen removal, both of Waffle’s previously angry lymph nodes broke out into multiple large tumors. Waffle’s cancer vet looked startled as he told me how “profoundly aggressive” the cancer was. We pursued every avenue of treatment, being extremely mindful of his quality of life the whole time. 

# About Cancer

For several months after diagnosis, I spent every free moment learning everything I could about Waffle’s type of cancer, cancers vaguely similar to Waffle’s cancer, cancer in general, the treatment options I was given, and basically anything about getting a better cancer outcome. It was engulfing, informative, and fascinating. I feel that some background is important for understanding treatment options and limitations. 

## What is Cancer?

[This page does a much better job summarizing what cancer is than I ever could](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer). 

[This video is also great for understanding what cancer is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ) The video is mainly about why blue whales *don’t* get cancer, but the background information on cancer is excellent, plus the illustrations are colorful and fun. 

Cancer cells multiply out of control. They don’t die when they should, they don’t stop growing when they should, and they can invade other tissues. Those are the basic characteristics shared between all cancers. Other than that, “cancer” is a broad term for a very diverse group of disease. What works on one person’s cancer is not necessarily going to work on another person’s cancer, even if they’re the same type.

Cancers are classified by the type of tissue that the cancer originated in and for the location where it first developed. Cancers within the same class can be extremely different from one another despite being the same type, with different mechanisms driving the malignant growth.

## The Insidious Nature of Cancer (Tumor Microenvironment)

The tumor microenvironment (TME) is the most fascinating part of cancer. It’s an extremely complex topic that I’m not going to pretend to understand, but it is the driving force of cancer and is part of why cancer is so difficult to treat. My apologies if my explanation isn’t super accurate.

Normal cells signal to each other on a molecular level to coordinate their functions and make our bodies run as expected on a cellular level. Cell growth is partially controlled by signals from other cells. Maladaptive changes to the cell growth and death cycle occur as a normal part of life. It happens all the time, but the immune system catches the malfunctioning cells and destroys them before they cause problems. Cancer starts when the immune system fails to identify and exterminate malfunctioning cells. 

Cancer cells grow and evade the immune system through manipulation of the TME. The TME consists of the normal cells, signaling proteins, immune cells, and other cellular and non-cellular components in contact with the malignant cells at a microscopic level. Tumors send out signals to hijack normal cells so they do what the cancer says. Those hijacked normal cells create a favorable environment for cancer growth by hiding the cancer from the immune system and recruiting cells to build blood vessels to fuel the tumor.  

Not so fun fact: In some cases, cancer grows so quickly that the cancer itself cuts the inner parts of the tumor off from receiving blood. These regions, starved of oxygen and nutrients, become necrotic and die. Unsurprisingly, tumors with this characteristic have a very poor prognosis. Waffle’s tumor had multiple lobes with necrotic regions at the center.

## Traditional Treatment Options

**Surgical Removal** - Surgery physically removes the tumor. If a single cancer cell was missed during removal, regrowth is possible. Removal requires a wide margin of healthy tissue to minimize chances of leaving a cancer cell behind. Chemotherapy may be recommended as a followup treatment to address remaining cancer cells, but not always. Some cancers grow quite slowly and chemotherapy may not be indicated.
 
Surgery carries the risk of seeding cancer cells elsewhere in the body during removal. The risk of this happening varies by type and location of the cancer. Hemangiosarcoma (cancer of blood vessel lining) is particularly prone to seeding since the tumors are usually fragile. When cancer cells break off, they immediately get swept up and carried to another part of the body through the normal, healthy blood vessels. 

**Cytotoxic Chemotherapy** - Cytotoxic chemo is what most people think of when they think of chemotherapy. “Cytotoxic” means “cell death”. Cytotoxic chemo acts directly on cells to kill them and shrink the tumor. Cytotoxic chemo is non-specific, meaning it affects all cells, not just cancer cells. Cytotoxic chemo has the greatest effect on cells that grow rapidly, which is why anemia, low white cell counts, and hair loss are side effects associated with cytotoxic chemo—blood cells and hair cells grow rapidly. Cytotoxic chemo for pets is typically administered intravenously every 2-3 weeks for 5-6 doses. A blood count is performed 7-10 days after the first dose to check the effect of the chemo on white cell counts. The size of the cancer is measured periodically to determine the cancer’s response to the drugs. Dose is adjusted based on the impacts to white cells, side effects, and cancer response. 

A NOTE ABOUT CYTOTOXIC CHEMOTHERAPY IN PETS: People get scared when they think of chemo. They usually know someone (a human) who had chemo and how miserable they were during treatment. The goal of chemotherapy in people and in pets is different. People are typically treated with chemo very aggressively to eliminate the cancer. Pets are treated to delay growth or stave off metastasis, not eliminate the cancer. The ultimate goal of treatment for pets is to extend the time the pet has good quality of life. Quality of life is a major guiding factor during treatment and doses or schedule are adjusted to minimize negative effects. Pets will not go bald the way people do because smaller doses meet the treatment goal for pets and those smaller doses don’t radically affect the hair. (One of Waffle’s cytotoxic drugs stopped him from growing hair or shedding. It was amazing to pet him without creating a fur tornado—a very rare situation when you own a Corgi, even when freshly groomed. It would have been magical if not for the circumstances!)

Some cancers become resistant and stop responding to chemo drugs. There are a number of mechanisms that cause cancer to become drug resistant, including plain ol’ natural selection. If cancer responds especially strongly to the first dose of chemo, the cells that aren’t killed off have some resistance to the drug. The remaining drug-resistant cells survive to reproduce, as is the case for multi-drug resistant bacteria and other so-called superbugs. When resistance to a drug is encountered, pet owners can opt to try a different drug. Waffle’s cancer responded extremely well to the first dose of chemo, reducing tumor size by 20%! His cancer became resistant to the drug after that first dose and continued to grow after the second dose was administered. 

**Anti-angiogenic Chemotherapy** - Anti-angiogenic drugs inhibit the growth of new blood vessels. Tumors require oxygen and nutrients to grow, which blood provides, but the tumor must build new vessels to get the blood where it needs to be.  Anti-angiogenic drugs interfere with vessel growth and, in doing so, interfere with cancer growth by starving the cancer of oxygen and nutrients. Cancer cells lose the ability to experience programmed cell death, but the cells *will* die if they do not have oxygen to feed them. Anti-angiogenic drugs are typically administered as a daily pill, known as “metronomic chemotherapy”. Side effects vary by drug. This is another non-specific treatment that affects normal cells as well as cancer cells.

# FidoCure

[FidoCure](https://www.fidocure.com/how-it-works) is a fairly new company that brings advanced medical technology to the veterinary field. FidoCure sequences the DNA of your dog’s cancer, identifies the exact mutations driving the cancer, and recommends drugs that target those mutation pathways. The FidoCure drugs theoretically have fewer, less severe side effects since they target the cancer, though that’s not the case for all the drugs in their roster.  

## Getting Started

I contacted FidoCure within a few days of receiving the biopsy results. They have a free consultation where a representative will call you, tell you if they’ve worked with a vet in your area before, explain the process, and get the name of your vet. They also say they will contact your vet before your next appointment to introduce themselves so your vet is at least somewhat familiar with them when you bring it up at the next appointment. 

You ask your vet if they are willing to work with FidoCure. If they agree, your vet will contact them and get the ball rolling. 

## Cost of Service

FidoCure did not give me a quote at any point during my direct communication with them. My vet is the one who received the quote and then passed it along to me. I’m not clear on whether there’s more than one pricing model with FidoCure so YMMV, but the cost I was quoted was thus:

* $1500 for the DNA test and report of the results sent to your vet

* $1500 for drug recommendation and lifetime drugs

That’s $3000 just for FidoCure’s service. The price DOES NOT include what you pay to your treating veterinarian for their services, which could represent a substantial sum. FidoCure recommends regular blood and urine analysis while taking any of the targeted therapies (which I am just going to refer to as “FidoCure drugs” from now on).  At my regular vet, a CBC, blood chem panel, and urinalysis is about $500; they send it out to IDEXX every time. Waffle’s cancer vet did not do all of the recommended testing; all of the testing that was done got done in-house, so it was much cheaper than it could have been! 

If you are considering FidoCure, I highly recommend that you ask your vet about price of the follow-up testing. The intense schedule of recommended follow-up tests was a surprise and caused me a great deal of strife. I would not have been able to afford an additional $500+ every other week, but I would have done it anyway because at that point I had already paid $3000 for FidoCure. Don’t put yourself in that situation; get an estimate for follow-up care before committing to FidoCure!

FidoCure contacts you directly for payment. It does not go through your veterinarian. 

## Your Vet and FidoCure

FidoCure is a consultant. The company does not work with you, the pet owner. The company works with your veterinarian. As such, **FidoCure is only as good as your treating veterinarian.** This is perhaps the single most frustrating aspect of FidoCure. There are questions about their product/service that it seems like they should be able to answer, but they won’t do it. You are supposed to ask your treating veterinarian. While I understand why this is the case, I wish they were a little more flexible with answering questions. Perhaps this is not a big deal when your vet has their shit together. (Mine did not.)

FidoCure is in direct contact with your vet. They explain what they found and what they recommend to your vet. They’re there to answer questions your vet may have and help your vet make decisions based on FidoCure’s findings. During treatment with the FidoCure drugs, FidoCure is available to your vet for consultation about changing dosage, side effects, and other things.

## The FidoCure Process

Once paid, your veterinarian arranges for a sample of the cancer to be sent to FidoCure for testing. It can take up to 5 weeks from receiving your FidoCure welcome email to complete the sequencing and report.

In some cases, FidoCure can recommend drugs prior to the DNA sequencing being completed. I’m not sure what situations this is true for, but “your vet screwed up and never sent the sample even though he said he did” is definitely one of them.

### The DNA Sequencing Report

After 5 weeks—hopefully less, possibly more—FidoCure contacts your vet with the DNA report. For each mutation, the DNA reports includes information on:

* The affected gene

* The type of mutation

* The normal functionality of the gene and the effects of mutation

* A score estimating the amount of harm the mutation does

* Potential therapy (drug recommendation)
 
There’s also an FAQ in there at the end for common questions about the FidoCure process.

## My experience with the FidoCure drug Vorinostat

The main driver of Waffle’s cancer was a mutation in gene P53, a tumor suppressor gene. He also had 2 separate mutations in gene SETD2, which has some tumor suppressor properties in its normal form. All three mutations are best managed with Vorinostat, a histone deactylase inhibitor (HDAC inhibitor). Vorinostat and other HDAC inhibitors act on the coiling of DNA, which has impacts to gene expression. It’s a drug that functions via epigenetics, up-regulating or down-regulating genes  by affecting transcription. Neat. 

Even though Vorinostat is described as a targeted therapy, I don’t really feel like it is. It acts on all cells, not just cancer cells. Like with cytotoxic chemo, it disproportionately affects cells that reproduce quickly. Vorinostat works best in conjunction with cytotoxic chemo, too, as it improves uptake of the cytotoxic chemo by cancer cells. 

Waffle experienced significantly worse side effects with the initial dose of Vorinostat than he had on either of his cytotoxic chemo drugs. We stopped the drug completely for a couple of months. When we reintroduced it, we adjusted the dose significantly and tweaked his medication schedule so the side effects were negligible. He had noticeably more energy and mobility while on Vorinostat. I’m not sure if it added anything to his survival time but it improved his quality of life once we got the dose and schedule right. 

# Final Remarks

I really like the concept of FidoCure. I love that they’re bringing advanced medical technology to our companion animals. I was extremely happy to participate in the advancement of medical care for our pets. The cost is surprisingly reasonable. Lifetime medication could be a few weeks or it could be a year or more, so it’s kind of a roll of the dice in terms of cost effectiveness. 

With exception of the difficulties I had due to the lack of action by my veterinarian, all of my interactions with FidoCure were positive. The interactions that weren’t positive were not negative! FidoCure just didn’t respond to me, only to my vet. It’s understandable, as they do not want to undermine the vet-client relationship. They checked in frequently between me paying the initial fee and receiving my dog’s cancer sample, which is not something they normally have to do. They wouldn’t have needed to do so if my vet actually did what he was supposed to do when he was supposed to do it. They were doing their best to make sure I was getting what I paid for even when my vet was not. That’s good customer service.

No, I did not get the results I was hoping for by using FidoCure, but I think I got the best results I could have gotten with my dog's specific cancer and the limitations of Waffle's vet. I am, ultimately, disappointed in the severity of side effects that my dog experienced on Vorinostat. It is not what I envisioned when I read about targeted therapies and definitely not what I envisioned when I committed a bunch of money to trying it. Still, I am glad that we tried. FidoCure was the best chance we had. If I could go back in time, there’s a lot of things I would do differently with regard to Waffle’s cancer. FidoCure is not one of those things. If your dog gets cancer, FidoCure is definitely worth trying. Even if it doesn’t give you extra time, it may help you make the most of the time that you have.",2021-06-05 18:15:34
Baby's first herding breed?,0,nx92gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nx92gn/babys_first_herding_breed/,18,1623392321.0,"I really want my next dog to be a herding breed. I love their trainability and athletic builds and the size range.

I do want to set the dog and myself up for a good time and acknowledge my lack of herding breed experience.

I'm not expecting to not have to exercise, train, and mentally stimulate the dog, but with other categories I have a grasp of ""easier and more challenging"" within the same category. A Weimeraner and a Golden are both gun dogs but I know which is likelier to be recommended to a first timer wanting a gun dog.

I can do this with Northern and ""Spitz looking"" breeds as well. 

But I'd really appreciate comparisons of herding breeds, especially from anyone who's had a couple different ones. 

I do research but breed comparison sites mostly list just ""high energy"" across the board for every breed I've looked at. The breeds I checked against that I do have experience with are also listed as ""high"" but there's no way they act the same. 

Some I've looked at -

- Rough/Smooth Collie: relatively low key? Happy to do my daily 5k then chill? I get weird reactions mentioning them to people it's like they've fallen totally out of favour and are a breed of the past.  

- GSD: semi-often recommended to me but I can't get a clear read on how calm they are as I've been told everything from very mellow stable lazy to not really appropriate for a suburban family. One friend is obsessed with White Swiss Shepherds and I'm not sure how distinct they are in temperament/drive. 

- Australian Shepherd: as popular as Collies aren't. I don't get clear answers on if they're as hyper as Border Collies. Are they healthier than Roughs? What's the secret of their popularity, are they a good gateway or just really cute looking to a lot of people?

- Shelties: they're bright, they're trainable, I've known some sparky ones that could definitely keep up with my 5k a day and hiking on weekends. I don't mind small but I am cautious of relentless barking. Part of me is quite torn in that a big Sheltie or a small Collie is quite an easy and manageable scale IF they are similar in temperament but I'd rather have a more mellow and low barking dog than the perfect size.

Is there a herding breed I'm missing that would be your recommendation? There's a couple more I think are wonderfully appealing but I really doubt would be best first gateway choices. But please, recommend away and prove me wrong! One of them is everywhere locally and common in rescue and if they were actually a good fit that would be great.

I have experience with walking and training or babysitting a lot of dogs but living with has been mostly a rescue staffy and American Akitas. So it's not unfamiliarity with dogs or large breeds it's just they're very different dogs.",2021-06-11 01:18:41
[Breeds] What other dog breeds are similar to the Corgi?

- They are small/medium sized dogs with the personality of big dogs.  
- They're smart.  
- They have enough energy to occasionally join us on a hike, but no so much that we need a massive lawn and 6 kids to keep it constantly entertained like a Border Collie might.  

Then we discovered that apparently corgis shed non-stop, which is a deal breaker for us since we own a small house (albeit with a medium sized backyard) and already have a cat that sheds almost more than what we can keep up with.  Also, apparently we learned that Corgis bark non-stop and would rather have a dog that isn't *too* loud since we do have neighbors and my wife works from home.

Now for reference, both my wife and I come from families that have owned a variety of dogs in the past.  We know how to care for dogs in the general sense.

And so now we are seeking a dog breed similar to the corgi - and possessing the above descriptors - but sans the copious barking and shedding.

My wife's family has been big on Scottish Terriers in the past and so now we are eyeballing that breed, but I wanted to reach out and see if there was perhaps another breed or two we may be overlooking.",2020-09-29 12:17:18

* I found one source saying they're naturally tailless, and I *so* wanted that to be true, but nope, [we amputate their tails.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi#:~:text=While%20some%20outlying%20Pembroke%20Welsh,conform%20to%20the%20Breed%20Standard.&text=The%20AKC%20Standard%20states%20tails,2%20inches%20(5%20cm\).) ^^^[Source2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog\))  However, I also just learned that, [in the UK, show dogs may not be docked.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(dog\)#United_Kingdom)  Looks like things are changing!  

Okay it's language time because [I am a writer](https://i.imgur.com/jmBl08t.jpg) and for some reason words and etymology really [floats my boat](https://i.imgur.com/JZTKLBf.jpg), really [peels my grapes](https://i.imgur.com/ocyZgcP.jpg), really [darns my socks](https://i.imgur.com/hCYjl0K.jpg).

>Etymology

>Borrowed from Welsh *corgi*, a compound of *cor* (“dwarf”) and *ci* (“dog”).

[Sources for notes on the proper pronunciation are here.](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corgwn)

And see [here for the specific *usage notes*, which read](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/corgi):

>Some breed authorities prescribe the **etymologically consistent plural form corgwn**. Nonetheless, the plural form corgis is considerably more common.

(So was ""foe"" [until we got it sorted!](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/pho_n_6084410#:~:text=Finally%2C%20if%20you%20need%20further,%22%20instead%20of%20%22feu.%22&text=This%20opens%20in%20a%20new%20window.)\)

>Also: ""The Pembrokeshire Corgi Handbook"" (1952) by C.L.B. Hubbard states: “**The plural of Corgi is Corgwn and not Corgis.**”

Oh and is the Oxford English Dictionary a good enough source? I know I certainly [knead it wile riting](https://i.imgur.com/k9nnpJT.png)... ""The Oxford English Dictionary [Second Edition]"" lists corgi as:

>Noun
>corgi (plural corgis or corgies or **corgwn**)

I see ""*or*"" and ""*or*"" and I'm like *fool of a Took!*  I really liked saying ""go for foe"" but we have to be proper twenty-first century citizens.  

I must admit that the spelling is tripping me up a bit...  But it's definitely ""corGOON"", I've some sources just to back me up.  I really wanted to be sure on that, and it wasn't just the accent of the [podcasters](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/) where I first heard it! 

Because [I'm a poet, and I didnt even realize it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-okDVcqGH8&app=desktop):  

Very soon we'll say **corgoon**.

Please [get a spoon and feed corgwn](https://youtu.be/ex6RuTk2Rdc). (One spoon twixt an unknown number of corgwn, I know, it could be *disastrous* but that is a risk I am willing to make you take.)

[A bright full moon shines on corgwn.](https://i.imgur.com/YRCMnWx.jpg)  

Also I feel like there should be a D&D spell called **Boon of Corgwn** but I should not continue to procrastinate to the extent of making up magical items to summon a hoard of corgwn... *must.. resist urge..*  

*Furthermore*, and extremely awesomely, if you type [the proper IPA (*not a beer*) spelling](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet)

    ˈkɔːɡuːn

into [this extremely cool text-to-speach IPA tool](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88k%C9%94%CB%90%C9%A1u%CB%90n&voice=Joey), you can hear it being said!  I may or may not have tried a bunch of accents XD

* We'll be living right across from a very large park and our apartment complex has an enclosed area
* Because I have never had a dog before and  I am pretty small (5 ft 4 and 95 lbs), I think my biggest fear is getting a dog I will be unable to control the dog while my boyfriend is not around once the dog is full-grown. (Ex: I've been knocked over by plenty of medium-sized, dogs that get very excited and I'd like to avoid that if possible)
* We are both fairly young. It may be possible within the next 15+ years we could be expecting a child

Other questions:

* what exactly is the purpose of the crate?
   * Would I need to put the dog in a crate when I'm working even though I'm home with it?
* In the foreseeable future (now until January 2022), I think there are 5 days over Thanksgiving that we would need a dog sitter or boarding. What would be the more ideal option?
* We'd like a puppy so we can train it and work out most of the behavioral issues I'm more worried about. Is that a reasonable expectation?",2021-06-28 16:01:44
[Vent] Ugh my new neighbors have a dog they won't leash,107,n5rbiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/n5rbiw/vent_ugh_my_new_neighbors_have_a_dog_they_wont/,49,1620250693.0,"I just got back from taking one of my dogs out for his afternoon walk and the people who just moved in a few houses down have this dog that just runs across the street or down the sidewalk any time he sees another dog. Thankfully, I was with my corgi and not my rescue because she'd have bitten the other dog. 

However, this is like the 3rd or 4th time I've seen this dog out without a leash on so I just laid into the woman who was out with him about needing to leash him since he clearly doesn't listen to her when she tells him to stay. He came barreling at us from across the street with cars driving by. 

I have no problem with off-leash dogs that actually listen to their owners but I'm terrified that this dog is going to run up when I'm out with my slightly reactive rescue who might bite this dog if she feels threatened.

I don't really know what to do because she seemed annoyed and not at all apologetic with how her dog reacted because my corgi isn't aggressive and did want to play with her dog. I live in an HOA neighborhood but I'm honestly not sure if leashes are a requirement but I know my city has leash laws.",2021-05-05 16:38:13

I just adopted a little 2 y/o corgi a week ago. I don't know much about his background except that he might have been in a kennel a lot and not socialized much. He's so sweet but is terrified everything. 

He doesn't respond to any words or gestures. He gets nervous if I'm standing or walking around him. And he freaks out when I put the leash on him (I don't think he's ever been walked). 

Over this last week, he's gotten a little better - he now mostly follows my roommate's dog outside to go to the bathroom (before I had to pick him up and bring him in and outside periodically). But I'm not sure how to help him gain confidence/feel more secure. 

Today I made a mistake and tried too many new things (I tried to get him to walk on a leash - BIG FAIL - and then gave him a bath) and now he's just as scared as he was a week ago and I feel AWFUL. I'm starting to get worried that we'll never be able to go on a walk or that he'll ever come when I call him. 

Any advice?",2020-11-29 21:09:38

Ever since we've had him we've noticed that he's a bit stiff to get up and groans when he lays down. We were told by his foster that he can handle stairs. We've found that he can go down them alright but either can't or won't go up so we carry him (no big deal). When he walks fast or runs, he'll kind of skip on one leg, then the other, and sometimes bunny hop on both. He jumps onto/off of the curb okay - he's fallen a couple of times but otherwise does fine! He seems to still really enjoy his walks. We play with him, but don't do anything too intensive. He'll also lay down in one spot, then move to a different one sometimes, like he can't settle himself. He also groans when he stretches.

We took him to the vet yesterday, and they said he didn't have luxating patella, but also didn't mention arthritis. He said he didn't know why he skipped but didn't offer anything else or suggest anything? I wanted to ask, but I was already having a hard time understanding the vet, and honestly, he wasn't the world's greatest vet (I have a ton of respect for vets, but he just seemed annoyed with us and didn't want to talk to us about our pup).

So my husband and I have a 16 month old daughter. I really want to get her a dog (I grew up with a dog and we had a dog that passed away before she was born).

The first thing is that it cannot be a big dog, a Rottweiler or a pit bull. We rent currently and while where we live now would allow any of those most neighborhoods in my town have heavy restrictions on Rotts and Pits plus almost no one rents to you if you have them. Same renting part applies to big dogs in general. Mostly because we plan to move in six months but not buy yet.

Second is what dog is best for toddlers/kids? Like enjoys a decent amount of walking everyday but not like 6+ hours of running outside and is easier to train I suppose? 

I was thinking a beagle or beagle mix (what I’ve had before and what google recommended). My local shelter only had pit bulls and Rottweilers (I like them, just can’t do it) so looking for suggestions from some dog lovers.

Help my mom find her dream dog! [Breeds],0,nolub9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nolub9/help_my_mom_find_her_dream_dog_breeds/,28,1622412426.0," **Introduction**
My mom lives alone and really wants a dog. She really loves huskies, but I’m worried about her being able to take care of one. I’m mainly trying to explore our options with this post. 

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Going through a breeder might be easier to find a dog that suits our needs, however, we would not mind rescuing a dog. 

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* Our ideal dog would have blue eyes, a fluffy but not super long coat, and a really cute smile. 

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My mother really wants a Husky because she loves the way they look, but I’m personally worried about her being able to manage one, especially since she has never owned or trained a dog before. Ideally I think we should get a dog that has some similar traits to Huskies but that isn’t as energy intensive. I’m personally fond of golden retrievers. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Main thing we want to train the dog to do is bark at the gate if someone comes in. We would also need to train the dog to not prey on and be gentle to other animals, as my mother owns chickens and the occasional kitten. I personally also want to train them to do cute little tricks. 

6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?

* Not really

**Care Commitments**

  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* We don’t really have a solid answer for this, but my mother thinks she can devote at least an hour per day and I can also help out if more time is needed. We are also willing to hire a trainer to help out. 

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* My mom doesn’t live near a dog park, but she does live on an enclosed piece of land that would allow for a bit of roaming. We’re mostly planning on that being their main source of exercise, plus we could probably do about one hour of play time everyday. 

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* My mother is willing to do daily brushing. As for other grooming tasks, it would depend and she is also willing to pay someone to do it when needed. 

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium sized would be preferred and we can be a little flexible on that, but we strongly don’t want a tiny “toy” dog. 

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding isn’t a huge concern, but both barking and slobber are. I personally have a noise sensitivity, so it can make me feel stressed when I’m around a dog that barks a lot. We’re also both comfortable with a bit of slobber, but we wouldn’t want a dog that actively drools a whole lot. 

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Honestly, not too important since my mom lives in a rural plot of land that’s completely fenced in. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Either is fine, but I’d personally like a snuggly dog :)

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* More on the independent side. 

15) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would want the dog to bark whenever someone comes in, but to not be hostile towards any guests. 

16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* We might also be taking in my grandmothers dog in the future, so if we get a dog now they would probably have to be okay with being around other dogs. 

17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* My mother really doesn’t like it when dogs lick her. 

**Lifestyle**

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Maybe a few hours a day, but otherwise my mother should be home. 

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My mom lives by herself and she is going to be the main one caring for the dog. 

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Cats and we also might take in my grandmother’s dog in the future. 

21) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* My mom lives in Romania. There are not breeds that are outright banned, but there are restrictions on certain dogs (Pitbulls, Rotweilers, Bull Terriers, etc.). We probably wouldn’t be interested in those types of dogs anyway. 

24) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summers are usually warm (80F), but can still get quite hot and humid at times. Winters are typically very cold (20F) and snowy. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

Really I'm looking more to see what people's paths were, and what degree of success they've seen. 

Right now, we've gone through several treatments, and seen some remission at points, but it's come back every time.

We started with CHOP, and it was doing well for a while, and I think it was during Vincristine we started seeing swelling of his lymphnodes go up again.

We were then going to get MOPP a shot, and started Mustargen, but that showed no real signs of affect, no decrease in lymphnodes.

We did L-spar, and they shrank very quickly, but L-spar can't be given too frequently.

We did Tanovea last Friday, but it seemed to almost no affect, his lymphnodes have gotten massive, his energy seems to be down in the past day, and he's started coughing a bit, seems to be having some trouble eating/drinking, and as of this morning, appetite seems to be declining (ate most, but not all of his food).

We have a vet appointment tomorrow, and they might try L-spar again, or I guess talk other options.

It's just hard to see him go through this, and I'd like to hear others' stories, good or bad, and potentially talk about it/ask questions.",2020-11-12 10:31:45

1 year ago my pregnant wife and I saved a little corgi puppy and named him Chips. Then our son was born and we tried to teach both of them. Surely we didn't have much time to train our dog every moment, but keep trying to find a time to do it each day. Now he is big enough, but we have several problems with him. If you can suggest anything, we will appreciate that.
- he bit us several times because of food aggression, we tried to teach him not to do that, and it is ok now, but our son starts to walk and could try to take Chips' toys, even if he plays at that moment. I am totally afraid that Chips could bite my son and it would be very painful and dangerous.
- he literally eats every toy he gets, especially if that toy has filler. So we stopped buying him cloth toys. Maybe it could be fixed. He chews even his bed. 
- he is very-very active, he can't sit at the spot and when we come home or get up everyday he jumps on us and could hurt us and possibly our son. 
- I can't watch reddit videos about human-dog friendship, because, Chips can't even lay down near me to rest, he is running and jumping all the time, then sleeps when we close him.
- He knows big amount of commands, like sit, lay, bark, wait etc, but he can refuse doing any one if we are outside. I even ran after him after i had unleashed him once, because he didn't want to come to me.
- He want to play with me all the time. If i can't play, he will be near me and barking, jumping on me, whining. If he is tired, in 10 minutes he will be near me to bark, jump, whine etc. Then i close him at bathroom and he takes a sleep. 
- when we  ride countryside, whole ride he whines at can't sit at a spot. 

I want to calm him down and be best friends, but all these problems are the wall between us.",2020-11-11 10:23:32
2 year old dalmation losing too much weight on new diet while other dogs are fine.,0,obmbvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/obmbvq/2_year_old_dalmation_losing_too_much_weight_on/,7,1625147671.0,"About 5 months ago we switched our 3 dogs (2 year old dalmation, 5 year old black lab mix, and 8 year old corgi mix) to home made dog food recipe. The recipe is as follows:

3lbs ground meat (usually turkey or beef),
1 cup chopped sweet potato,
3 cups brown rice,
1 bag of chopped baby carrots,
1 cup of kidney beans or lentils,
1 frozen bag of vegetables (typically peas or green beans),
A couple tablespoons of Seameal dietary supplement

We cook a big vat of this at once and it will last us about 3 to 4 days. We give the dalmatian and lab 1 cup in the morning and another cup in the evening. The corgi gets 1/2cup. The lab, which is of a comparable size and weigh to the dalmatian, has had no issues with the food but the dalmation has lost a significant amount of weight recently. Their hip bones and spine are visible when they curl up. 

This isn't our first dalmatian so we are aware of the health problems inherent in the breed. This dalmatian also has ear problems that they are treated for. My question is this, does the recipe above have any red flags? Are they not getting enough protein or carbs? We are taking him to the vet today but I wanted to see if anyone else had any hands on experience with feeding dalmatians home cooked food and if they had any insights or suggestions.

(Side note in case anyone was curious: we switched to the home cooked dog food because we figured it was healthier than canned food and it turns out to be slightly cheaper. The dogs go crazy for it, too. The little corgi mix used to turn her nose up to everything we gave her but actually gets excited for food time now.)",2021-07-01 08:54:31

For 7 years she was my best friend. She herded our labradors and ran the household. She was a grouchy old lady but so sweet at the same time. She was the first dog I really had that connection with where she was my dog and I was her person.

I was getting ready to move into my post-college apartment. We were going to do a trial to see if Tavey liked it since she was getting up there in age and we didn't want to stress her out. However, when I came home she was breathing super heavily. My parents said it started that day. We took her to the vet first thing in the morning and they told us she couldn't feel her legs and was trying to die. She either had a tumor or threw a blood clot in her spine. They told us the most humane option was putting her down. 

I got a few minutes to say goodbye and stayed with her while she left but it was so quick. I wish I had given her more treats and a few extra hugs, but we didn't know she was in so much pain or that I would be leaving the vet without my best friend.

Want to adopt but don't know what!,0,o5zjq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/o5zjq5/want_to_adopt_but_dont_know_what/,10,1624402532.0,"Hi,

Since moving into my new apartment recently, I've been searching for a dog, but don't know what breed to consider or what to consider.

I am wanting a dog to help with my anxiety and to be a companion of mine when we go out to do hikes, walks, and having a journey with each other.

I've helped in raising dogs like corgis and jack Russell terriers, but I would have to say I am a beginner. 

I work for 4.5 hours four days a week and I am a student. Once school starts again I would be at the apartment more often, but because of that I would still be giving the dog walks, and probably a lot more stimulation toys or feeders. If I'm going to be gone on a trip and can't take them, there are daycares near where I can take them. I'd probably take them there as well depending on what breed I get.

My apartment is probably close to 500- 620 SQ ft, it's pretty large in my opinion, since I haven't gotten a lot of stuff. My dining room is empty and I have a bit of room in my living room, so the dog could run around and relax in the apartment.

I don't have a backyard, but I do have a beautiful large park a block from my place so the dog would have lots and lots of room to run around and play.

I've wanted to get a pitbull for a while, but I have to consider when I'm adopting a bite history, aggression towards other dogs, cats, children, etc and what their fear and anxiety is like. It's frustrating me a little bit. I love pitbulls because they are loyal, cute, and I've wanted one for a while. They are like big cuddly babies to me.

I have considered other breeds like a Labrador retriever, retrievers, and some other dogs that don't have high energy like pitbulls do. 

Should I just get a breed I'm interested in and just learn what it means to take care of them?

Thank you for letting me explain/ rant.",2021-06-22 17:55:32
Trying to avoid a pet scam...,2,nwvpti,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nwvpti/trying_to_avoid_a_pet_scam/,18,1623352119.0,"So I was talking to this breeder from Craigslist (I know I shouldn’t) who seemed sketchy, like she had very broken English over text and told me she wasn’t showing pictures of the puppies until they were older. However when I stopped replying, she started sending pictures that she claimed to have taken this morning. I reverse image searched the pictures and found them on a Russian search engine called Yandex. When I called her out, she got very defensive and told me her name and her Facebook page, and left me a voicemail about how she “doesn’t like being called a liar.” There were other concerning things as well, like corgis was spelled  “Corgies” in her Facebook name, and she claimed it was because her first page got shut down (also strange) and she couldn’t use the same name.

But then she sent me many images of her with the puppies and the parents, and said I could come meet them this weekend. Her voice on the voicemail appeared to match who she claimed to be (older woman) and she has an internet presence, although mostly horse racing and work-related stuff but not about breeding corgis. 

Should I be worried? She seemed concerned about her images being online but kind of ignored me and got back to the topic of the puppies once I started to tell her she should do a virus sweep. She is very persistent with her texts, which also seems odd because a legitimate breeder would likely just not respond if someone was being “difficult” with them like I was. 

Could those pictures have gotten online without her posting them anywhere? Overall, does this seem strange?",2021-06-10 14:08:39

I often wonder if I should learn how to groom dogs and do that for a living, but then I think about the owners and I go “yuck, humans. Never mind.” Maybe I’m too sensitive and thinking about working with dogs who just want to be loved and cared for sounds like a dream. I have a corgi pup who is my LIFE.

Maybe?) a year ago and we’ve been going on off-leash hikes at our local dog parks where she greets most other dogs with friendly indifference but also LOVES when she finds a buddy to get a chase going. I’ve never seen her exibit any agression towards other dogs. 

We live in a city and have had a really boring routine since I brought her home. She would socialize on walks and hikes but because of the pandemic she NEVER experienced anyone but me in her space. 

Now we’re on our first trip together and visiting my parents house in the country with acres of nature to explore and my parents 1 year old corgi. He is incredably well socialized and submissive and I completely fucked up the first meeting. On day 1 we let them play as soon as she got out of the car and they were having fun but instead of giving her treats and cutting it short I let him keep following her around after she started ignoring him. 

We’re staying in the guest house so they don’t need to share a space but I did everything wrong and let him come in and lick her bowl and get all up in her space and then brought her into the main house where ALL of his toys and high value chews are and then sat on the floor and let him sit on my lap IN FRONT OF HER. Obviously incredibly stupid. After 3 days she attacked him. 

I realize she’s been in a state of arousal from the newness of the environment, plus her territorial insticts kicked into overdrive with this much property to patrol. She literally ran away from me, completely ignoring the voice commands we’ve worked on all over our city for the last year, to walk the perimiter of the property line. She was waiting at the door with her tongue out when she finished. I was trying to give her as much excersize as possible because tired dogs are good dogs but I realize that went 180 and was just adding to her stress. 

So now I’m keeping them separate and her on-leash until she decompresses a little. How can I go back and get her to to be nice to him now that we've established this bad behavior? ",2021-07-03 16:00:30

Eventually I'd love for the dog to come out with me on outings - hiking/kayaking/fishing. I'll be providing plenty of exercise and play-time but would also like a dog that is laid-back and snuggly for chilling out on the couch afterwards and doesn't need to go on regular runs/jogs when I'm working on the weekdays. My ideal dog would be just as calm and happy going to meet up with another dog owner at a coffee shop as they would be going out on a nice hike and picnic. I have a smaller yard so I'm looking for a medium dog. Dog, person, and cat friendly preferably. 4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?* I've been seriously considering Schnoodles, Cockapoos, or Goldendoodles. I am also open to Golden Retrievers. 5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?* Basic Obedience, Agility Training. 6) Do you want to compete with your dog in a sport (e.g. agility, obedience, rally) or use your dog for a form of work (e.g. hunting, herding, livestock guarding)? If so, how much experience do you have with this work/sport?* Yes, I plan on doing obedience and agility training. I have already successfully trained my Corgi. I plan on also working with a personal trainer. **Care Commitments**  7) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?* On weekdays I'll devote 1 hour to training, and have several play-times/walks/exercise throughout the day.

What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  *  Daily several shorter walks and one long walk in the evening.

Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?* I already brush my corgi every morning, and do trims, ear cleaning, and baths as needed. We go to a local dog groomer every 3-4 months. That's about as much grooming as I'd like to do. **Personal Preferences**10) What size dog are you looking for?* A medium dog, small is also fine.11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?* Any amount is fine! 12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?* Moderately, I'll be doing plenty of obedience training.

How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  * I'm okay with a bit of alerting, it'd be nice if the dog was more laid back. I plan on doing plenty of exposure training but would like a relatively friendly dog. 16) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?* Yes, but would prefer it to be friendly. 17) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?* Not especially! **Lifestyle**18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?* 4 hours occasionally, if ever longer another person will come and check up on the dog and walk it. 19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? * I have a partner who also loves dogs and will support me in caring for the dog. 20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?

I'd love some assistance in picking the right dog for me and my SO, who have (what feel like) pretty strict restrictions between the two of us. More breakdowns in the notes at the bottom. Also, if I'm just being unreasonable, that feedback might be useful too.

&#x200B;

* No. Would love to rescue, but also selfishly want an adorable puppy and have a lot of restrictions, which likely makes it hard

&#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* This is where it gets complicated. Hypo-allergenic \*which I know isn't technically a thing\*, 30-40 pounds, snuggly, relatively fluffy, fairly average temperament and exercise needs.

&#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Retrievers, labs, huskies, etc. But all realistically too big and too tough on allergies for my situation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Care Commitments**

&#x200B;

8) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

9)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&#x200B;

**Personal Preferences**

10)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 20-40 lbs

&#x200B;

11) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal shedding, moderate barking (less preferred, but I can work with it), minimal-moderate slobber.

&#x200B;

12) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not at all in practice, but I think it would be cool.

&#x200B;

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

&#x200B;

13) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly. Doesn't have to want my attention all the time, but if I wanted a cat I'd get a cat.

&#x200B;

14) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* No strong preference.

&#x200B;

* No.

&#x200B;

**Lifestyle**

&#x200B;

18) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Fewer than four hours per day, likely.

&#x200B;

19) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Shared preferences and care.

&#x200B;

20) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No, but possibly far in the future.

&#x200B;

22) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* Yes, standard restrictions, but giant dogs and pit-bulls were off the menu anyway.

&#x200B;

23) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* USA, no.

&#x200B;

**Additional Information and Questions**

25) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* **The crux of my request is this**: my SO has dog allergies and wants a hypo-allergenic breed. We're both aware that technically those don't exist, but she is confident that the traditional hypo-allergenic breeds, or a mix including them, will work for her.
* I had multiple poodles and malteses growing up, and while I loved them all, I know that they're not what I want in the future - I want bigger than a maltese (20+ pounds), but fluffier and cuter (sorry) than a poodle.
* However, nixing poodles from the mix makes it very hard to find a hypo-allergenic (it seems like the technical term is single-coat?) option that will still meet my size and cuteness needs. I'm pretty traditional in my preferences, and while all dogs are cute, I want mine to be traditionally cute.

Thank you in advance for any guidance, this is on track to become an issue for us.

EDIT: Guys, come on. I don’t want a poodle due to personal preference. I had poodles growing up. I know they’re fine dogs. I just don’t want one. I don’t need to be educated about poodles. Also, I’ll exercise my dog as often as it needs to be exercised, I’m not imprisoning the poor thing. If I wanted a cat, I’d be in r/cats. Thank you to those of you who have helped educate me on the business and/or made suggestions.",2021-05-18 14:51:59

I have done some research and everything says that going up stairs are a good exercise for dogs. We live on the 15th floor of our apartment building.

What would be the right thing to do in this situation?,1,nvq7x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/nvq7x1/what_would_be_the_right_thing_to_do_in_this/,18,1623225024.0,"My partner and I have wanted a dog for a very long time but are waiting until we have more time for one in the future (we both work full-time and don't want to leave a dog at home for 9 hours a day - or pay for doggy daycare all week) so we often go for walks with our friends who have dogs to catch up with them and also get our doggy fix. :D


A couple of weeks ago, we walked with some friends who have two rescues. A 3 legged lab and a little corgi-terrier mix. We were in a woodland and the lab was off lead, bounding around like a happy lunatic as always and the corgi mix was on his lead shadowing mum as always.


Up ahead was a large, kind of Akita-German Shepherd mix, I think? Being held by a 12 year old girl and with her mum. When this dog saw the corgi-mix, he ripped out of the girl's hand and sprinted rather scarily all the way down to the corgi mix (about 100m) and got right up to him to sniff his backside. Ignored the lab completely. This dog was looking super intense and not friendly to me. My friend stood very calmly and did not react at all but looked to the owner who had tried recalling him with no luck and was now walking very slowly and reluctantly back to get him.


The 12 year old girl then comes running up and grabs her dog by the harness and the dog suddenly goes into a really aggressive and scary growling and snapping state at the corgi-mix. Now he's mostly restrained, my friend starts to slowly walk away and meanwhile the owner is still strolling back and calls ""oh don't worry, his bark is worse than his bite"" and eventually gets hold of her dog and they literally have to drag this dog away because he's utterly fixated on my friend's dog.


So my friend stayed calm and did not react which seemed to be the right thing to do in this situation but I can't stop thinking 'but what if the dog _had_ attacked? What's the right thing to do if you have a small, on-lead dog and a massive beast sprints away from their owner and actually attacks your dog?


I've thought about it constantly since and I hate the idea that I wouldn't know what the right thing to do would be if I had a small-medium dog who was attacked if their owner couldn't control them.


I would love to hear people's thoughts.


Edit: Sorry, just to note - When I say I've thought of it constantly since, I mean in a kind of mind wandering back to it thoughtfully kind of way. I'm not traumatised. :) I grew up with dogs myself but I guess we never had small dogs in my family so this hasn't happened to me before where a big dog has been fixated on a small one when out walking.",2021-06-09 02:50:24
[Help] I've posted here about our corgi having a mysterious injury where he cries if you gently touch his sides. I think we know what's wrong now but don't know how to fix it. How do we best keep him from slipping on the floor???,2,j4z0bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/j4z0bl/help_ive_posted_here_about_our_corgi_having_a/,5,1601818452.0,"We have a 3.5 - 4 year old corgi, Bobby. I've posted before about his mysterious injury, but I'm having issues accessing my account, so here I am with a new one.

When you touch his sides, but only gently, he cries. Never when you apply pressure.

Took him to yet another vet and after MORE xrays, poking and prodding, this one thinks she knows what's wrong. She thinks he has some nerve damage from falling down the stairs as a pup, and thinks it hasn't healed because we have mostly tile flooring (but it's the fake type where it's just flat and printed and kinda slick, not stone, and with no grout). She thinks he is slipping when he walks because he waddles like a penguin, being a corgi, and he did that at her office too, and she thinks that's why his likely soft tissue injury isn't healing and is still causing him issues.

He is on Carprofen and Gabapentin now, and doing great.

The problem is, she gave us a ton of options for how to fix this and we don't know what's best.

- Booties. I think he would be miserable in booties and would need serious conditioning... but are these the best option?

- Treads for the bottoms of the paws? Do these actually work? Wouldn't he just chew them off and potentially hurt himself?

- Toe claw grips. These look promising but I don't understand how they work. Already ordered them though.

- Carpeted runners everywhere until he heals. We like this idea too but he likes to walk close to the walls so we would have to get serious coverage and that might end up costing a ton. But if it's necessary, we'll do it.

- Paw wax. Does that get everywhere?? Really like this idea too.

- Are we missing any other options?

Thanks for all your help. You folks rock!",2020-10-04 08:34:12
